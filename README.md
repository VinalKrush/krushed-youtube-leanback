      - Streaming in 4K resolution is seamless on a PC, avoiding buffering issues and quality limitations that some TVs impose due to bandwidth or hardware constraints.

      - Potential HDR playback capability enhances video quality for users with HDR-capable monitors or displays, providing vibrant colors and improved contrast.
      6.	Better Hardware Performance

      2.    Thumbnails Are Low Resolution
      - Thumbnails for videos are displayed in lower resolution compared to the YouTube website or mobile apps, which might make them less visually appealing.
      3.    Some Videos Will Autoplay In 480p
      - For a unknown reason, some videos will autoplay in 480p, even if your PC is capable of playing them in a higher resolution. though you can change it back to 1080p or higher.
      4.    No Support for YouTube's Picture-in-Picture Mode
      - Unlike YouTube on mobile and browser, this application does not support picture-in-picture mode.
      5.    More And Longer Ads
