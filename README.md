## Pros And Cons

### Pros:

1. Almost Zero Lag

- Experience smoother playback and navigation without the input delays common on TV apps. This ensures quicker access to content and a more responsive overall experience.

2. Faster Responding UI

- The user interface is more responsive compared to the often sluggish performance of YouTube apps on older or less powerful TV hardware.

3. 4K Streaming with Ease

- Streaming in 4K resolution is seamless on a PC, avoiding buffering issues and quality limitations that some TVs impose due to bandwidth or hardware constraints.

4. HDR Support (Untested)

- Potential HDR playback capability enhances video quality for users with HDR-capable monitors or displays, providing vibrant colors and improved contrast.

6. Better Hardware Performance

- PCs generally have more powerful processors and GPUs than most smart TVs, resulting in smoother playback and better multitasking if needed.

8. Convenience and Flexibility

- Easily switch between YouTube and other tasks or apps on your PC, making it a better choice for multitaskers or those who want more control over their viewing environment.

9.  Chromecast

- Users can easily cast content from YouTube mobile to their PC using Chromecast, offering a seamless viewing experience across devices.

### Cons:

1. No Voice Control

- Unlike some smart TVs, this application does not support voice commands, which might be a drawback.

2. Thumbnails Are Low Resolution

- Thumbnails for videos are displayed in lower resolution compared to the YouTube website or mobile apps, which might make them less visually appealing.

3. Some Videos Will Autoplay In 480p

- For a unknown reason, some videos will autoplay in 480p, even if your PC is capable of playing them in a higher resolution. though you can change it back to 1080p or higher.

4. No Support for YouTube's Picture-in-Picture Mode

- Unlike YouTube on mobile and browser, this application does not support picture-in-picture mode.

5. More And Longer Ads

- This application does not block ads (because it's against TOS), and YouTube on TV is known for having more and longer ads then YouTube mobile and browser.
